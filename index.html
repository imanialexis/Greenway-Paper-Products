            <h2>Why go Green ?</h2>

            <p>
                Paper is one of the few truly sustainable products. Paper is based on wood, a natural and renewable material. As young trees grow they absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Furthermore, as a wood product, paper also continues to store carbon
                throughout its lifetime. The paper industry has a number of respected certification schemes ensuring the
                paper you use has come from a sustainable forest source. The two most recognisable certifications are the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC™).</p>
             <p> 
                FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) helps take care of forests and the people and wildlife who call them home.It runs a global forest certification system with two key components: Forest Management and Chain of Custody certification. This system allows consumers to identify, purchase and use wood, paper and other forest products produced from well-managed forests and/or recycled materials.FSC’s “tick tree” logo is used to indicate that products are certified under the FSC system. When you see the FSC logo on a label, you can buy forest products with confidence that you are helping to ensure our forests are alive for generations to come.
